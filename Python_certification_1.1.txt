1.What are the supported standard data types in Python?
Ans => The supported standard data types in Python include:
       Lists
       Integers
       Strings
       Dictionaries
       Tuples
       Boolean
       Set

2.What are tuples?
Ans => Tuples are a sequence data type with immutable values in Python. The number of values i tuples is separated by        commas.

3.What is the major difference between tuples and lists in Python?	
Ans =>There are several major differences between tuples and lists in Python, which include the following:

Tuples :- Tuples are similar to a list, but they are enclosed within parentheses, unlike the list
          The element and size can be changed
          They cannot be updated
          They act as read-only lists
          Tuples use parentheses
          Example: tup = (1, "a", "string", 1+2)

list:- The list is used to create a sequence
       The element and size cannot be changed
       They can be updated
       They act as a changeable list
       Lists use square brackets
       Example: L = [1, "a" , "string" , 1+2]

4.Define self in Python.
Ans => Self is an instance of a class or an object in Python. It is included as the first parameter. It helps differentiate        between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.

5.What is the Pass statement?
Ans => A Pass statement in Python is used when we cannot decide what to do in our code, but we must type something to make        it syntactically correct.

6.Why do we need a break?
Ans => Break helps control the Python loop by breaking the current loop from execution and transferring the control to the        next block.

7. In how many ways can we apply reverse strings?
Ans => Loops
       Recursions
       Stacks
       Extended slice syntax
       Reversed function

8.How to comment with multiple lines in Python?
Ans => To add a multiple lines comment in python, all the line should be prefixed by #.

9.11) What is the difference between remove() function and del statement?
Ans => The user can use the remove() function to delete a specific object in the list.

Example:

       list_1 = [ 3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3 ]   
       print(list_1)  
       list_1.remove(3)   
       print("After removal: ", list_1)  
Output:

       [3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3]
       After removal: [5, 7, 3, 9, 3]

10. What are the different types of operators in Python?
Ans => Python uses a rich set of operators to perform a variety of operations. Some individual operators like membership        and identity operators are not so familiar but allow to perform operations.

       Arithmetic OperatorsRelational Operators
       Assignment Operators
       Logical Operators
       Membership Operators
       Identity Operators
       Bitwise Operators

11.What is lambda in Python? Why is it used?
Ans => Lambda is an anonymous function in Python, that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single        expression. It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period. Lambda        functions can be used in either of the two ways:

Assigning lambda functions to a variable:
       mul = lambda a, b : a * b
       print(mul(2, 5))    
     # output => 10
Wrapping lambda functions inside another function:
       def myWrapper(n):
       return lambda a : a * n
       mulFive = myWrapper(5)
       print(mulFive(2))   
     # output => 10

12.What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?
Ans => .py files are Python source files whereas .pyc files are the compiled bytecode files that are generated by the         Python compiler.

13.Define iterators in Python?
Ans => In Python, an iterator can be defined as an object that can be iterated or traversed upon. In another way, it is        mainly used to iterate a group of containers, elements, the same as a list.

14.What happens when a function doesnâ€™t have a return statement? Is this valid?
Ans => Yes, this is valid. The function will then return a None object. The end of a function is defined by the block of        code that is executed (i.e., the indenting) not by any explicit keyword.

15.What is a boolean in Python?
Ans => Boolean is one of the built-in data types in Python, it mainly contains two values, and they are true and false. 
       Python bool() is the method used to convert a value to a boolean value.

16.What are the functions in Python?
Ans => In Python, functions are defined as a block of code that is executable only when it is called. The def keyword is        used to define a function in Python.
Example:

       def Func():
       print("Hello, Welcome toMindmajix")
       Func(); #calling the function
Output: Hello, Welcome to Mindmajix

17.. Define the term lambda?
Ans => Lambda is the small anonymous function in Python that is often used as an inline function.

18.How can we make a Python script executable on Unix?
Ans => In order to make a Python script executable on Unix, we need to perform two things. They are:
       Script file mode must be executable and
       The first line should always begin with #.

19.Explain the difference between local and global namespaces?
Ans => Local namespaces are created within a function when that function is called. Global namespaces are created when the        program starts.

20.Name some of the built-in modules in Python?
Ans => The built-in modules in Python are:

       sys module
       OS module
       random module
       collection module
       JSON
       Math module
